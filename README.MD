🧠 Discrete Math vs Continuous Math

    Discrete	            Continuous
    Countable	            Infinite / smooth
    Integers	            Real numbers
    Graphs	                Calculus
    Logic	                Differential equations


💻 Python Libraries Useful for Discrete Math

    NumPy → matrix operations
    SymPy → symbolic math
    NetworkX → graph algorithms
    itertools → combinatorics

🎯 Why Discrete Math is Important for You

    If you're studying:
    Machine Learning
    Data Science
    Software Engineering
    Cybersecurity

Then discrete math is mandatory because:

    Algorithms are built on it
    Data structures use it
    AI logic depends on it
